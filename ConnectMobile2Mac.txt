1.  Check Java installed in system or not. 
    > java --version    // Java should be available in your system

2. Check that android studio setup done and is in $PATH 
   > export ANDROID_HOME="/Users/macbookpro/Library/Android/sdk"
   > export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"
   Now adb should be in the path. 

   to make this change permanent: 
   > nano ./.bashrc   //  or try nano .bash_profile  // nano ~/.zshrc
   Paste the above two lines and Ctrl+x > Save - > Restart the system or 
   > source ~/.bashrc   // 
3. Connect android mobile phone using USB and developers mode enabled. 
   > adb devices     // Will list the device in the list 
                     // Location of platform tools: /Users/macbookpro/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools 
   > Check device id  // List should not be empty 
4. Install Vysor to browse your mobile. We will need this for checking different informations. 
   After installing try connect your phone using Vysor. In my case mouse control was not working. So, I tried following 
   > Turn off wifi
   > Turn on Mobile Network 
   > Enable "Install Via USB" in Developer Options. 
   This solved my problems.
